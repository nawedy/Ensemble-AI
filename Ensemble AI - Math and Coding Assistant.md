  * Facilitates seamless deployment and updates.  
  * **Reference:** [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)  
* **API Versioning:**  
  * Implement robust versioning to ensure backward compatibility when new models are introduced.  
* **Plug-and-Play Modules:**  
  * Define abstraction layers where specific model implementations are isolated from the core logic.  
  * Use dependency injection patterns to manage service dependencies.  
* **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**  
  * Set up CI/CD pipelines for each microservice to allow continuous improvements and rapid deployments.  
  * **Reference:** [AWS CI/CD Best Practices](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-integration/)

### **5.2 Future-Proofing Considerations**

* **Dynamic Model Loading:**  
  * Develop a plugin system where models can be dynamically loaded or replaced.  
* **Modular API Contracts:**  
  * Use OpenAPI/Swagger to define and document service contracts.  
  * **Reference:** [Swagger OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/)  
* **Feedback Loop Integration:**  
  * Integrate user feedback mechanisms to continuously refine and choose the best-performing models.  
* **Scalability:**  
  * Design services to scale horizontally using cloud auto-scaling and load balancing.  
  * **Reference:** [AWS Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/)
