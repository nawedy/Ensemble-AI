Comprehensive Rules for High-Quality, Efficient, and Scalable Development
Ensuring UI Consistency with DaisyUI & shadcn/ui
Rule: To maintain a modern and consistent design across the application, all UI components should be implemented using DaisyUI (with a choice of dark, synthwave, or sunset themes) and shadcn/ui.
How:
Apply DaisyUI themes globally: This will ensure that the chosen theme (dark, synthwave, or sunset) is applied consistently across all components, providing a unified visual experience.
Utilize pre-built shadcn/ui components: shadcn/ui provides a range of pre-designed components that align with modern design principles. By using these components wherever possible, you can save development time and ensure that your UI elements adhere to established design standards.
Minimize custom styling: Custom styling should only be used when absolutely necessary to achieve specific design requirements that cannot be met by DaisyUI or shadcn/ui components. Excessive custom styling can lead to inconsistencies and increase maintenance efforts.
Justification:
Accelerated development: Using pre-built components and established design patterns can significantly speed up development time, allowing you to focus on core functionality.
Visual consistency: By adhering to a consistent design system, you can create a cohesive and professional-looking user interface that is easy to navigate and understand.
Reduced maintenance: A standardized UI design with minimal custom styling is easier to maintain and update, as changes can be applied globally and consistently.
Improved collaboration: A clear set of UI guidelines and a shared library of components can improve collaboration among developers, designers, and other stakeholders.
Additional Considerations:
Component library: Consider creating a component library that encapsulates commonly used UI elements based on DaisyUI and shadcn/ui. This can further streamline development and ensure consistency across different parts of the application.
Accessibility: Ensure that the chosen DaisyUI theme and shadcn/ui components meet accessibility standards, making the application usable by people with disabilities.
Testing: Thoroughly test the UI with different DaisyUI themes and shadcn/ui components to ensure that they work correctly and display as expected in various browsers and devices.
Documentation: Document the UI guidelines, including the use of DaisyUI themes, shadcn/ui components, and any custom styling rules. This will help maintain consistency and onboard new team members.

Modular & Reusable UI Components
Rule: To ensure a clean and maintainable codebase, UI elements should be designed to be modular, reusable, and well-structured. This approach not only streamlines development but also enhances the overall user experience.
How:
Break UI into Atomic Components: By decomposing the user interface into smaller, self-contained components, each responsible for a single functionality, you create building blocks that can be easily reused and rearranged.
Avoid Monolithic Files: Large, monolithic files can quickly become unwieldy and difficult to manage. Instead, opt for creating separate files for each reusable component. This promotes code organization and clarity.
Clear and Self-Explanatory Names: Using descriptive names for components makes the codebase more readable and understandable, reducing the cognitive load for developers who are working with the code.
Justification:
Improved Code Maintainability: Modular code is inherently easier to maintain. Changes and updates can be made to specific components without affecting the entire codebase.
Simplified Debugging: Isolating issues becomes less cumbersome when dealing with modular components. The source of a bug can be quickly traced to the relevant component.
Enhanced UI Consistency: Reusable components ensure a consistent look and feel across the application, leading to a more polished and professional user experience.
Accelerated Development: Having a library of reusable UI components speeds up development time, as developers can leverage existing components instead of building everything from scratch.
Facilitates Collaboration: Modular code promotes collaboration among developers, as different team members can work on separate components simultaneously.
By adhering to the principle of modular and reusable UI components, developers can create robust, scalable, and user-friendly applications that are both efficient to develop and easy to maintain.

Component Documentation
Rule: Each UI component must include clear, structured documentation.
How:
Add JSDoc-style comments describing:
Component purpose
Props and state dependencies
Usage instructions

For each item, feature, or component you start working on, you should: make sure that it is well-documented, that it is tested, and that it is integrated with the rest of the system. Also, each item, task, feature, or component you start working on, yous should complete it 100% before moving on to the next item where possible and it is done within a way that it is easy to understand and easy to maintain.
