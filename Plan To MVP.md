  * Three separate microservices, each with documented API endpoints.  
  * Unit and integration tests for each service.  
* **Tools & References:**  
  * [GitHub Copilot Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot)  
  * [OpenAI GPT-4 Documentation](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4)

#### **2.2 VSCode Extension Development**

* **Tasks:**  
  * Develop a robust chat interface embedded within VSCode.  
  * Implement drag-and-drop document upload functionality.  
  * Connect the VSCode UI to the API gateway to route requests appropriately.

  * Establish CI/CD pipelines early in Phase 1 to automate testing and deployment.  
  * Tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or AWS CodePipeline can be used.  
* **User Feedback Loop:**  
  * Integrate tools for capturing user feedback directly within the VSCode extension.  
  * Use analytics to monitor user behavior and refine the system post-launch.  
* **Documentation & Training:**  
  * Create detailed developer guides for the modular architecture.  
  * Ensure onboarding documentation is in place for future model swaps.
