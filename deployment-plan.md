# Deployment Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (1-2 weeks)

### 1. Infrastructure Setup
- Set up Vercel project for frontend deployment
- Configure GCP project (free tier)
- Set up GitHub repository with proper branching strategy
- Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD

### 2. Core Architecture
- Create base Next.js application with App Router
- Set up DaisyUI and shadcn/ui with chosen theme
- Implement basic Supabase integration
- Set up basic API structure with tRPC
- Configure environment variables for all environments

## Phase 2: MVP Core Features (2-3 weeks)

### 1. Authentication & Database
- Implement Supabase Auth
- Create initial database schema
- Set up basic user management
- Configure proper RBAC

### 2. Essential Services
- Math Service integration
- Code Service integration
- Reasoning Service integration
- API Gateway with proper routing

### 3. Basic UI
- Create component library
- Implement responsive layouts
- Set up error boundaries
- Add loading states

## Phase 3: Testing & Optimization (1-2 weeks)

### 1. Testing
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Performance testing

### 2. Optimization
- Implement caching strategy
- Add error logging (using free tier services)
- Optimize API response times
- Implement proper error handling

## Phase 4: Deployment & Monitoring (1 week)

### 1. Staging Deployment
- Deploy to staging environment
- Test all integrations
- Verify environment variables
- Check performance metrics

### 2. Production Deployment
- Set up production environment
- Configure monitoring (free tier)
- Implement health checks
- Create deployment documentation

## Phase 5: Post-Deployment (Ongoing)

### 1. Monitoring & Maintenance
- Monitor error logs
- Track performance metrics
- Handle bug fixes
- Document known issues

### 2. Optimization
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Optimize database queries
- Improve caching strategies
- Reduce API latency

## Key Considerations

### Cost Management
- Stick to free tiers where possible
- Monitor usage to avoid unexpected costs
- Use serverless where appropriate
- Implement proper caching to reduce API calls

### Performance
- Use SSR strategically
- Implement proper caching
- Optimize bundle sizes
- Use proper indexing for database queries

### Security
- Regular security audits
- Proper authentication flows
- Data encryption
- Regular dependency updates

## Timeline
Total estimated time: 5-8 weeks for initial deployment
- Phase 1: 1-2 weeks
- Phase 2: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 3: 1-2 weeks
- Phase 4: 1 week
- Phase 5: Ongoing

## Success Metrics
- Deployment completed within timeline
- All core features functional
- Response times under 200ms
- Zero critical security issues
- Coverage > 80%
